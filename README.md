---Task 6 â€“ Subqueries & Nested Queries

  --This task focuses on writing SQL queries using subqueries in the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses. I explored scalar subqueries, correlated subqueries, and derived tables.

---

---What I Did

  --Used *subqueries* to filter and fetch data based on nested logic.
  --Wrote queries using `IN`, `EXISTS`, and scalar subqueries.
  --Practiced *correlated subqueries* and *subqueries inside FROM* as derived tables.
